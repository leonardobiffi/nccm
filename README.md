Manual install instructions
---------------------------

This is the easiest way to install nccm, you can of course
install and use nccm in any way you wish.

* Clone the project from the git repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/leonardobiffi/nccm.git`
* `cd nccm/nccm/`
* `sudo install -m 755 nccm -t /usr/local/bin/`


The ssh connections/config file `nccm.yml` should be
copied to any one of the following locations, and is
loaded from the first location found:
- `~/.config/nccm/nccm.yml`
- `~/.nccm.yml`
- `~/nccm.yml`
- `/etc/nccm.yml`


nccm requires Python3 to be installed on your machine,
which should already be present on most Linux boxes.
Most Python library dependencies are already present
as part of Python3 however the following may not be
present in which case you need to install them manually.


On Debian or similar use apt:
`sudo apt install python3-pip yamllint`

On Fedora or similar use dnf:
`sudo dnf install python3-pip yamllint`

Then install PyYAML:
`pip3 install --user PyYAML`


Before starting, edit the `nccm.yml` file and add your
own ssh connections. Formatting YAML is easy and the file
you downloaded from the project page is well documented
and has examples of every supported scenario.
Follow the structure in the file - provide the connection
name at the beginning of a line and sub config items
indented by two spaces. Don't forget the colons - these
are part of the YAML language.

Don't worry about ordering your SSH session blocks in any
specific way because nccm gives you "sort by" options
within the program.

Once you've finished editing, check your work with yamllint:
`yamllint nccm.yml`

If no errors are returned, then you've formatted your file
correctly, and it's safe to continue.

If nccm is accessible from your path and is executable,
typing nccm is all that's required to launch the TUI
(terminal user interface).
If you see Python 3 exceptions, check whether you have
satisfied the dependencies. Any exceptions should mention
any package that's missing.


nccm.yml settings
-----------------

This file is mostly used for ssh connection details, but
also supports program settings as follows:

`nccm_config_controlmode`:
Controls the cursor movement mode. Two modes are supported:
- std:    Cursor keys move the marker as expected.
- focus:  Marker and list move independently.
          The list is designed to move while the marker
          remains fixed unless it is moved manually.

`nccm_config_loglevel`:
Controls log level of messages sent by nccm to syslog.
Use this for debugging. Default level is warning.
Supported levels: debug, info, warning, error, critical


Controls
--------

In nccm_config_controlmode == std mode:

- Up/Down arrows:     Move the marker the traditional way
- Home/End:           Jump marker to list first/last entry
- PgUp/PgDn:          Page up/down in the list

In nccm_config_controlmode == focus mode:

- Up/Down arrows:     Scroll the list up/down
- Home/End:           Jump to list first/last entry
- PgUp/PgDn:          Page up/down in the list
- Shift Up/Down:      Move the marker up/down
- Shift Left/Right:   Move the marker to display top/bottom

In both modes:

- Left/Right arrows:  Scroll the list horizontally
- Tab:                Switch between text boxes
- Enter or Ctrl-m:    Connect to the selected entry
- Ctrl-h:             Display this help menu
- Ctrl-k              Toggle cursor mode std <--> focus
- Ctrl-q or Ctrl-c:   Quit the program
- F1-F5 or !@#$% :    Sort by respective column (1-5)


Usage
-----

`Conn` textbox:
Accepts integer values only (and !@#$% for sorting).
Pressing Enter here will connect to this connection ID,
as corresponding to a valid value in the full
unfiltered list (even if that particular connection
is hidden by unmatching text in the `Filter` textbox),
ignoring everything else (`Filter` textbox, highlighted
line) - even if they don't match.
If this textbox is empty, it will connect to the
connection marked by the highlighted line.

`Filter` textbox:
Type any filter text here.
Accepts any printable character and space.
Text is forced to lowercase, and the resulting filtering
is case insensitive.
Pressing Enter will connect to the connection highlighed
in red. This also works if you're in the `Conn` textbox
and it's empty.

Textboxes accept backspace to delete one char backwards,
inline editing not supported.

Displayed connection list is filtered by the combined
contents of all the fields as you type in real time.
Spaces delimit filters if typed into `Filter` textbox
and all filter entries are AND'ed.

nccm_config_controlmode == focus was inspired by vim
where you can move your display up/down around your work
while keeping your current line selected.


Sorting
-------

F1-F5 keys sort by the respective fields 1-5.
The display shows 4 visible columms but we treat
username and server address as separate columns for
sorting purposes.
The Fn keys may be captured by certain GUIs so we have
an alternative - when focused on `Conn` window, press
Shift-1 through 5 (!@#$%) to toggle sorting by the
respective field number. If you type these special
characters in the `Filter` textbox they become standard
filters just like any printable character.
Pressing the same key again reverses the sort order.

```
Column #  Column name       Sort    Alternate sort
--------  -----------       ----    --------------
1         List serial #     F1      !
2         Friendly name     F2      @
3         User name         F3      #
4         Server address    F4      $
5         Description       F5      %
```


Limitations
-----------

Will not store passwords. Please don't request this
feature because it won't be added.
Either use ssh passwordless login (by placing your
public key on the server in `.ssh/authorized_keys` - tip:
look up `ssh-copy-id`) or store your password in a
password manager and paste it when prompted.

Does not like window resizing and exits gracefully
displaying an error message.
It's safe to resize the window once connection
establishment is in progress or after connected to
your server.

Does not support highlighting filter keywords in search
results because this results in a messy and confusing
display once more than a couple keywords are used.

Text entry is limited to the length of the textboxes
which in turn are dictated by the width of your window.
This should be enough for most use cases though.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Starting nccm:
The most common problem is missing Python3 dependencies.
Run nccm and read the exception message - it will tell
you what's missing.

Logging:
Look at your syslog file for nccm entries. Depending upon
the verbosity level set in the config file you may not see
much if at all anything.
By default the production level of the script logs WARNING
and above which results in syslog silence until something
bad happens.
To increase logging verbosity change this line in the
nccm.yml config file to debug:
`nccm_config_loglevel: debug`
Also - more debugging calls exist but are commented out in
the code due to too much logging. Enable them as required.


Hacking nccm
------------

Take something good and make it better!
The code is heavily commented, with the hope that it will
make life easier for modders and forkers.

The config file is simple yaml. If you already have a
collection of logins elsewhere in an accessible format -
writing a script to convert and append fields to nccm.yml
is easy.


Misc
----

This program aims to do one thing well - lets you make SSH
connections from an ncurses based manager with minimum
distraction. Feature requests that keep nccm on focus will
be considered.
